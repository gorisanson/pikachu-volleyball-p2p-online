            Pikachu Volleyball is an old Windows game which was developed in
            Japan in 1997. You can play this game here online by establishing a
            peer-to-peer connection with someone else also here.

          This P2P online version is not going to work on your network. It is
          one of the following two cases. It is recommended that, first, do the
          troubleshooting on (2).<br /><br />
          (1) The necessary server reflexive candidate can't be gotten. Maybe
          the reason is that the necessary UDP ports are blocked. If you
          connected via a corporate network, maybe the firewall is blocking the
          UDP ports.<br /><br />
          (2) If your computer is assigned a public IP address (since your
          computer is connected directly to the internet without a router), the
          server reflexive candidate is not necessary. But it can be the case
          the public IP address is obfuscated to mDNS by the web browser since
          it is somehow treated as a local IP address. In this case, on the
          Chrome browser, visit the page
          <a
            href="chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns</a
          >
          (by copying and pasting the address) and change the setting of
          "Anonymize local IPs exposed by WebRTC" to "Disabled". Then, this P2P
          online version would work.
